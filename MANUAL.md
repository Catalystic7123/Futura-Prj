# Futura Chron V1: Official User Manual & Video Script

Welcome to the future of temporal price analysis. **Futura Chron V1** is a high-precision engine designed to identify "confluence windows"—points where time and price meet in mathematical harmony.

## 📺 Video Script / Walkthrough Guide

### [0:00] Introduction: The Interface
"Welcome to the Futura Chron V1 dashboard. Our new 'Quantum Glass' interface is designed for high-stakes analysis, keeping all critical data points visible in a single, low-latency workspace."

### [0:30] Section 1: The Header & System Status
- **Identity**: Top left shows your current build version.
- **Status Indicator**: Watch the status pill (Idle, Scanning, Live, Halted).

### [1:00] Section 2: Location Grid (The Spatial Anchor)
"Every analysis begins with a geographical anchor. Use the **Preset** dropdown to quickly snap to global financial hubs. This adjusts your **Latitude** and **Timezone**."

### [1:45] Section 3: Date and Time (The Temporal Range)
"Define your search window here. The **Range** determines how many days forward the engine looks, while the **Step** defines granularity."

### [2:30] Section 4: Price Matrix (The Financial Vector)
"Input your **Matrix High** and **Matrix Low**. The **Vector Preview** shows the calculated geometric angle of your current price range."

### [3:15] Section 5: Time Mapping (The Engine Core)
"This is the heart of the app. Choose your **Engine Mode** based on your strategy: Squared Minute for Gann logic, Asc@anchor for trend starts, Mc@anchor for peaks, or Relative for velocity."

## 🛠 Deep Dive: Mastery of MC and Relative Modes

### Mc@anchor (Midheaven): The Zenith Engine
The Midheaven (Medium Coeli) is the highest point on the ecliptic at a given moment. In the Futura Chron engine:
*   **The Physics**: If the Ascendant is the *breath* of the market (inhale/start), the MC is the *peak* of the breath (fullness). 
*   **Tactical Use**: While the ASC is excellent for finding long entries or trend reversals from a bottom, the MC is specifically tuned to **Institutional Supply Zones**.
*   **The "Ceiling" Effect**: When price hits a confluence point in Mc@anchor mode, it suggests the trend has reached its natural structural height. Use this for **Profit Taking** or **Short-Sell** strategies.

### Relative Mode: The Velocity Engine
Relative mode ignores fixed anchors in favor of the *relationship* between moving points (e.g., the distance between the Moon and the Sun, or two user-defined temporal vectors).
*   **The Physics**: This measures "Angular Distance." It identifies when the *speed* of the market's price expansion matches the *speed* of the celestial clock.
*   **Tactical Use**: Best for identifying **Breakout Persistence**. If a Relative match occurs during a strong trend, it confirms that the market "Velocity" is in harmonic sync, and the trend is likely to continue.
*   **Vector Synchronization**: Use this to find "Harmonic Clocks"—recurring cycles that don't depend on a fixed start date, but rather on the recurring *gap* between phases.

## 🧠 Advanced Confluence Strategy
1.  **Strict Confluence**: Enable this in the Time Mapping panel to filter out noise. Only entries where *both* the Price Vector and Time Vector hit an exact degree (within your Tolerance) will be marked `STRONG`.
2.  **Tolerance Tuning**: Start with a tolerance of `0.5`. If you get too many results, tighten it to `0.1` to find the "True Zero" of the vibration.
3.  **Sidereal Offset**: When mapping large historical cycles (decades), always enable **Lahiri** to account for the wobbling of the Earth's axis (precession).
